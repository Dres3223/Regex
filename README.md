# Project: Regular Expressions Exercises

This repository contains several practical exercises that utilize regular expressions to solve common problems in areas such as text processing, data validation, cybersecurity, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into multiple files, each focusing on a specific exercise:

### 1. **Big Data and Data Preprocessing**

- **File**: `oneExerciseRegex.py`
- **Description**: Cleans and normalizes large volumes of text by removing HTML tags, URLs, emojis, and special characters.
- **Technologies**: Python, `re` library.
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how regular expressions can be used for text preprocessing in Big Data workflows.

---

### 2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- **File**: `twoExerciseRegex.py`
- **Description**: Detects email addresses in a textual dataset using regular expressions.
- **Technologies**: Python, `re` library.
- **Objective**: Showcase the use of regular expressions for tokenization and pattern detection in NLP tasks.

---

### 3. **Structured Data Extraction**

- **File**: `threeExerciseRegex.py`
- **Description**: Extracts structured information (temperature, humidity, timestamps) from unstructured sensor logs.
- **Technologies**: Python, `re` library.
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how regular expressions can structure data from unorganized sources.

---

### 4. **Emotion Detection in Text**

- **File**: `fourExerciseRegex.py`
- **Description**: Detects keywords associated with emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear) in a text.
- **Technologies**: Python, `re` library.
- **Objective**: Investigate how regular expressions can help detect emotions in textual data.

---

### 5. **Web Scripting and Validations**

- **Folder**: `fiveExerciseRegex`
  - **Files**:
    - `index.html`: Contains the web form.
    - `styles.css`: Defines the form's styling.
    - `script.js`: Implements real-time validation.
- **Description**: Validates user inputs in real-time (email, password, phone number) using regular expressions.
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Objective**: Demonstrate how regular expressions are applied in web forms for data validation.

---

### 6. **Cybersecurity: SQL Injection**

- **File**: `sixExerciseRegex.py`
- **Description**: Detects basic SQL Injection patterns in user inputs.
- **Technologies**: Python, `re` library.
- **Objective**: Investigate how regular expressions can identify SQL Injection attempts.

---

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Web Browser**: To test the web validation form.
- **Libraries**:
  - `re`: Standard Python library for regular expressions.
